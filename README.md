This paper is an 8000-word Film Research Analysis on Popular Culture. The Aim of this paper is to compare the difference of two films of similar content but of different ages. In this paper, I discuss and compare two Disney films: Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Maleficient(2014), the latter is the adapted and live-action version of animated Sleeping Beauty. Besides, I also combine Steven Johnson’s theory in the book Everything bad is good for you to better analyze these two popular films.
